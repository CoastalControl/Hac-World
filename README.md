Kai here,  I like to try out new things.  One day I purchased a Dell E6220 Latitude from E-Bay.  I believe I paid $95.00 for it at the time.  It came with a fresh version of Windows 7 Ultimate and Microsoft Office 2010.  It worked well until I tried to change some BIOS settings.  There was a password attached to the BIOS.  I contacted the seller and explained my delima.  The seller gave me $64.00 off and I was eventually able to reset the BIOS password after researching the internet for how to accomplish this task.  
So, I had this nice laptop for $31.00 and was looking for a new extended life battery for it when I came across a web page explaining how to load OS X into this machine.  Wow,  I really like OS X Yosemite!  That would be great!  After much reading and experminting, I was able to load Yosemite on the machine.
